# Image-Video-Classification

This repository contains examples of object detection and classification using pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) models with OpenCV. The examples demonstrate image classification, video object detection, and multi-object detection in images.

**Prerequisites**  
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Google Colab (for cv2_imshow)


**1. Single Image Classification with DenseNet**
This example leverages the DenseNet architecture, known for its high efficiency and accuracy, to classify a single object in an image. Utilizing the cv2.dnn module from OpenCV, this example demonstrates the seamless integration of neural networks for image classification.


**2. Multi-Object Classification in Images with SSD MobileNet**
This example utilizes the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) combined with the MobileNet architecture for real-time object detection. The script showcases how to detect multiple objects within a single image, using the cv2.dnn module and the COCO dataset.


**3. Real-Time Video Object Classification with the cv2.dnn module**
In this example, we perform real-time object detection on video frames using the SSD MobileNet model. The script showcases the power of OpenCV's cv2.dnn module, processing video streams for dynamic object detection.
